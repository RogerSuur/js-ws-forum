# real-time-forum

The goal of the project was to create a forum where you are able to message with other users in real time.

### USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

1. Git clone https://01.kood.tech/git/Jollyroger/real-time-forum-typing-in-progress.git to your desired folder
2. Open real-time-forum repository in your terminal
